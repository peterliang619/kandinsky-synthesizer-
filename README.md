# Kandinsky Synthesizer

A creative synthesis tool inspired by Wassily Kandinsky's abstract art principles.

## Creative Thinking Methodology: SCAMPER

This project embraces the SCAMPER creative thinking framework to explore and transform sound, visuals, and concepts. SCAMPER is a powerful brainstorming technique that encourages innovation through seven key approaches:

### 🔄 Substitute
**Replace a thing or concept with something else**

- What elements can be substituted?
- Who else could be involved?
- What materials can replace existing ones?
- What other processes could achieve the same result?

*Example: Replace sine waves with square waves, substitute visual colors with sound frequencies*

### 🤝 Combine
**Unite ideas, materials, or concepts**

- What can be combined to create something new?
- Can we merge different sounds or visual elements?
- How can we blend techniques or approaches?
- What happens when we unite contradictory elements?

*Example: Combine audio synthesis with visual generation, merge multiple sound sources*

### 🎨 Adapt
**Adjust to a new purpose**

- How can we reshape this for a different use?
- What needs to be tuned or adjusted?
- Can we adapt techniques from other domains?
- How can we modify it to fit a new context?

*Example: Adapt visual art principles to sound design, reshape audio curves for visual output*

### ✏️ Modify
**Change the attributes: color, sound, motion, form, size**

- **Magnify**: Make it larger, stronger, thicker, higher, longer, more frequent
- **Minify**: Make it smaller, lighter, slower, less frequent, reduce complexity

*Example: Increase amplitude, slow down tempo, reduce harmonic complexity, amplify certain frequencies*

### 🔀 Put to Another Use
**Change when, where, or how to use it**

- Can this be used in a different location or context?
- What if we change the timing or sequence?
- How else can this be applied?
- Who else could use this?

*Example: Use audio algorithms for visual generation, apply rhythm patterns to color transitions*

### ✂️ Eliminate
**Omit, simplify, or remove**

- What can we get rid of?
- How can we simplify?
- What's unnecessary?
- What happens if we remove constraints?

*Example: Remove effects, strip down to basic waveforms, eliminate visual complexity*

### ↩️ Reverse
**Change the order, sequence, or arrangement**

- What if we flip it?
- Can we reverse the sequence or pattern?
- How can we rearrange the layout?
- What happens if we regroup or redistribute elements?

*Example: Play audio backwards, invert color schemes, reverse the synthesis pipeline*

## Getting Started

Explore the synthesizer using these creative principles to discover new sounds, visuals, and combinations. Experiment freely and let creativity guide your process!

## Project Philosophy

Like Kandinsky's approach to abstract art, this synthesizer encourages breaking traditional boundaries and exploring the synesthetic relationship between sound and vision. Use SCAMPER to continuously innovate and discover new creative possibilities.
